The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...

1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

报数序列是以如下数值开头的序列：
1,11,21,1211,111221, ...

1被读作“一个1”即11，
11被读作“两个1”即21,
21被读作“一个2,一个1”即1211。
给定一个数值n，生成第n个序列。

注意：序列应表示为字符串。
